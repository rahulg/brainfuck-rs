# Wut?

An interpreter for [brainfuck](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck).

I was bored, saw [this](https://github.com/jin/scala-brainfuck-interpreter) on Facebook, and decided to write one too.

# Building

* Debug: `cargo build`
* Release: `cargo build --release`

# Running

```
$ brainfuck hello_world.bf
```
